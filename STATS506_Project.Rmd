The goal of this tutorial is to demostrate the use of Logistic Regression, and model diagnostics for this type of regression. We will start this tutorial by explaining the algorithm and the modeling behind Logistic regression. This would be followed by an illustrative example using three statistical software languages: Python, R, and STATA.

###Algorithm
Logistic regression is a predictive modelling algorithm that is used when the response variable is binary categorical variable, i.e. it can only take two values: 0 and 1.
